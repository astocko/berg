The Bloomberg terminal offers thousands of functions to choose from, including instant messaging, corporate earnings estimates, commodity prices, charts and, arguably most importantly, news. Across many functions, the terminal interface is characterized by a dark background. Text and other elements stand out in colors like bright blue and bright orange, and not just currency-oriented red and green.

This theme was developed specifically with the presentation of headlines and news articles in mind. As a result, it is probably best suited for reading and writing text -- for example, in Markdown format.
