# berg
A Visual Studio Code color theme inspired by the Bloomberg terminal.

The Bloomberg terminal offers thousands of functions to choose from, including instant messaging, corporate earnings estimates, commodity prices, charts and, arguably most importantly, news. This theme was developed specifically with the presentation of headlines and news articles in mind. As a result, it is probably best suited for reading and writing text -- for example, in Markdown format.
